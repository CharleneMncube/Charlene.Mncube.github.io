                                            <h3>A TUMULTUOUS START</h3>
											<h5>| 2017 – 2019</a></h5>
											<p>
												
												After matric, I went wayward, which put me in a situation where I ended up taking a gap year. During that time, I attempted to enroll in the National Defence Force to realize my teenage dream of 'working for the CIA,' which I quickly reconsidered. I ended up working at a restaurant, where I was able to save up some money to take myself to university to study engineering. Needless to say, that experience helped me build real-world resilience and independence. Serendipity knocked at the door, and I was fortunate to receive sponsorships, which helped me realize my dream of becoming an engineer.
												
												
												
												
											</p>

                                        <h3>AN ATTEMPT TO FUTURE PROOF MY CAREER</h3>
										<h5>| 2020</a></h5
										
                                        <p> During my final year of studies, I was uncertain about which career path to pursue as a young engineer, given the variety of options available. Sponsored by a private bank, I gained exposure to the banking industry and discovered roles within the financial services sector where my engineering skills could be utilized. Despite the surge in the data science and analytics field, I chose to continue with the traditional engineering path. However, I also embarked on part-time studies in data science, not only as a way to create a 'career cushion' during the pandemic but also to upskill and best position myself in the ever-evolving competitive job market (Engineering was no longer the talk of the Town). I used my extra time to learn after hours. Despite the challenges posed by remote work and demanding coursework, I successfully completed the program, gaining expertise in various data management, gathering, and visualization tools, as well as machine learning systems and the entire data science pipeline. Now, I was faced with the decision of what to do next?.

                                            <p> 
												As I ventured into exploring career avenues beyond engineering, I stumbled upon the McKinsey Women in Engineering program. Participating in this event not only expanded my perspective regarding potential career paths beyond engineering but also provided a platform to connect with remarkable women across diverse engineering disciplines. This experience offered me insights into their operational practice and the pivotal role of consultants mainly from STEM backgrounds. I further engaged with a diverse group of women who had seamlessly transitioned from engineering to management consulting, gaining valuable professional and personal development advice from women who had walked our path.

											<h5>| 2013 - Present</a></h5
                                            <p> I am now well within 5 years of my career as an engineer - 10 000 hours - yes?, and I've noticed that not much of the innovation I envisioned has been effectively implemented locally in the industry yet. However, the industry is steadily starting to recognize the importance of optimizing their business with technology. Currently, I work in the offshoring unit on transportation projects in Australia and New Zealand, which has provided an incredible opportunity to collaborate with some of the industry's best engineering minds. Nevertheless, the disconnect between working on first-world projects while living in a developing country emphasizes the discrepancy and highlights how much further we need to go as a continent to achieve world-class sustainable and innovative infrastructure. 

Though we use sophisticated engineering software, there is still room for more efficient solutions both on-site and in the office. Recently, I presented the digital twin model for our company's roads learning week and realized my interest lies in unearthing innovative solutions to solve complex business problems. As an engineer, I have acquired invaluable skills and knowledge, which makes me an intrinsic problem solver.  

Unfortunately, engineers are undervalued in South Africa, leading to the current brain drain. The industry needs adequate funding and support from an innovation fund to fully thrive. As a young professional, I will continue to adapt and evolve with the disruptions and apply my diverse skills to make a global impact.

As a child, my wish was not to just have a fancy titled job but to use my intellect, love for helping
others along with my desire to make humanity's lives easier to serve humanity with purpose and

fulfilment. I quote Prof Kourosh Kayvani who mentions how" the world needs more fearless, human-
centred engineers who are capable of resolving humanity’s “wicked problems” and that right there

is something I would want to fulfil. Leaving a legacy for young girls who aspire to change the world
and to be fearless with their goals is something resonates with my own struggles and achievements I
have experienced. My overall goal is to live a life that will fulfil me, allow me to explore all my
capabilities and serve a meaningful purpose to humanity."
