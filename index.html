Being a part of this society was instrumental in keeping me engaged as an engineering student, as it provided a sense of community that made the university experience a lot less stressful. In addition to the community aspect, the networking opportunities offered through the society bridged the gap between my status as a student and my aspirations to become an engineer.

										<h5>| 2019</a></h5>
                                        <p>
						Like many civil engineers, my career aspiration was to improve communities and the economy by being the brains behind civil infrastructure design. However, the reality of the role of a civil engineer in our country was underwhelming compared to the picture I had in my mind. In my third year, a presentation by Dr. Gabrielle Wojtowitz from a top engineering consulting company on the use of AI and virtual reality in their engineering projects sparked my interest in the synergy between engineering and technology. For my final year dissertation, I researched the impacts of the 4th Industrial Revolution on the Civil Engineering Industry, which allowed me to network with like-minded industry professionals and learn about emerging technologies and disruptors. What excited me the most about my studies was the potential value propositions emerging tech had for the engineering industry. I believed that I could be a voice and contributor to the change and bring my ideas to life someday.

                                        <p> During my final year of studies, I was uncertain about which career path to pursue as a young engineer, given the variety of options available. Sponsored by a private bank, I gained exposure to the banking industry and discovered roles within the financial services sector where my engineering skills could be utilized. Despite the surge in the data science and analytics field, I chose to continue with the traditional engineering path. However, I also embarked on part-time studies in data science, not only as a way to create a 'career cushion' during the pandemic but also to upskill and best position myself in the ever so evolving competitive job market. I used my extra time to learn after hours. Despite the challenges posed by remote work and demanding coursework, I successfully completed the program, gaining expertise in various data management, gathering, and visualization tools, as well as machine learning systems and the entire data science pipeline. Now, I was faced with the decision of what to do next?.

											<p>During the COVID lockdown, I was ideating on opportunities where I could apply my skills for a positive impact and came across the 'Safe @ Home Hackathon - Send Assist Victim in Danger (S.A.V.I.D)' challenge sponsored by Microsoft. This challenge aligned perfectly with my passion for social-tech. I and a few curious minds decided to create a tech driven solution, which we later named UNCEDO Reliable Relief Powered by Technology, which aimed to develop an affordable technology solution to address gender-based violence in South Africa. The solution had to cater to victims using older phones without transport means, identify hotspots, recognize at-risk individuals, profile perpetrators, and offer alert systems for educators, social workers, and the community. We focused on making our solution economical and accessible to rural communities.

After 20 weeks of interactive learning, I am now well-equipped to confidently face my tasks and learn and lead with purpose. 	</p>

											<h5>| 2019 - Present</a></h5
                                            <p> I am now well within 4 years of my career as an engineer, and I've noticed that not much of the innovation I envisioned has been effectively implemented locally in the industry yet. However, the industry is steadily starting to recognize the importance of optimizing their business with technology. Currently, I work in the offshoring unit on transportation projects in Australia and New Zealand, which has provided an incredible opportunity to collaborate with some of the industry's best engineering minds. Nevertheless, the disconnect between working on first-world projects while living in a developing country emphasizes the discrepancy and highlights how much further we need to go as a continent to achieve world-class sustainable and innovative infrastructure. 

Though we use sophisticated engineering software, there is still room for more efficient solutions both on-site and in the office. Last year, I presented the digital twin model for our company's roads learning week and realized my interest lies in unearthing innovative solutions to solve complex business problems. As an engineer, I have acquired invaluable skills and knowledge, which makes me an intrinsic problem solver.  

Unfortunately, engineers are undervalued in South Africa, leading to the current brain drain. The industry needs adequate funding and support from an innovation fund to fully thrive. As a young professional, I will continue to adapt and evolve with the disruptions and apply my diverse skills to make a global impact.
